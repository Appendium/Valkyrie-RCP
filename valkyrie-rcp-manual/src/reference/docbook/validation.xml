    <title>Why validation</title>
    <para>
      Users make mistakes. They won’t admit it, but they do. As GUI developers, our task is to make sure that their
      mistakes don’t crash or cripple our system. Input validation can help a great deal with this. Valkyrie
      supports validators for various input. These are all subclasses of RichValidator.

      <title>Using the rules framework</title>
      <para>
        Valkyrie has created their own validation framework, which is rule based. A change to a value it put
        through a number of checks, which are contained within a rule, and results in a success or a validation error.
      </para>
      <para>
        The FormModelHelper can create formmodel with rule validation by providing a RulesSource in one of its factory
        methods.
      </para>
      <para>
        A rule source contains different rules for a certain object type. If, for example, we want to validate that the
        field1 property of the TestObject class is never empty, we can create a RulesSource like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[DefaultRulesSource source = new DefaultRulesSource();
Rules rules = new Rules(TestObject.class);
Constraints c = new Constraints();
rules.add(c.required("field1"));
source.addRules(rules);]]></programlisting>
    </section>
    <section id="validation:rule:contraints">
      <title>Constraints</title>
      <para>
        Constraints contain the actual logic that checks the values.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Constraints class contains a lot of predefined constraints. Among these you can find
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Maximum length of string
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Maximum value
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Not null

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        Creating your own constraint is done by implementing the Constraint interface, which consists of one method
      </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface Constraint
{
    boolean test(Object argument);
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        This constraint will test any object. Most of the time, we’ll want to split up functionality to check individual
        properties, so that we can reuse this logic elsewhere.
      </para>
      <para>
        For this, you’ll need to subclass AbstractPropertyConstraint, which needs a property name. Also, in it’s test
        method, it provides an easy way to get values of individual properties.
      </para>
      <para>
        Say we want to create a constraint that checks whether a String property’s value equals “RCP” (silly, but a good
        example). We’ll end up with something like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class RcpConstraint extends AbstractPropertyConstraint
{
    protected boolean test(final PropertyAccessStrategy domainObjectAccessStrategy)
    {
        Object prop = domainObjectAccessStrategy.getPropertyValue(getPropertyName());
        return !(prop instanceof String) || ((String) prop).equals("RCP");
    }
}]]></programlisting>
      <para>
        This constraint you can then add to your RulesSource for a specific property.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="validation:rule:triggers">
      <title>Validation triggers</title>
      <para>
        Validation on a property is triggered when that property is changed in its valuemodel. Valkyrie will
        search for rules for that property and execute them.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="validation:rule:dependent">
      <title>Dependent properties</title>
      <para>
        Some rules that are registered for a certain property need to be triggered when another property is changed (for
        example two dates, for which the first needs to be before the last). Valkyrie supports this by
        overriding the isDependentOn(…) method. Out-of-the-box, this method returns true if the parameters equals the
        property name for which the rule is defined. However, you can add additional properties to this method. Every
        change in a property that returns true on this method will cause this rule to be checked.
      </para>
      <para>
        An example of this type of rule is the RequiredIfTrue constraint. This constraint can accept a property and
        another PropertyConstraint. For example, you want the driver’s license number required if the age of the person
        is over 21. Creating a constraint for this would be something like this:
      </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[Rules rules = new Rules(Person.class);
rules.add(new RequiredIfTrue("driverLicenseNumber", new PropertyValueConstraint("age",
                new Constraint()
                {
                    public boolean test(final Object argument)
                    {
                        return ((Integer) argument).intValue() >= 21;
                    }
                })));]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        This constraint will be fired if the value of driverLicenseNumber or age is fired. Mind you though, the
        validation error will only be reported on the ‘main’ property, which is driverLicenseNumber.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="validation:rule:custom-messages">
      <title>Setting i18n messages for custom rules</title>
      <para>
        Getting the message for a custom rule is done by implementing TypeResolvable in your constraint class. For
        convenience, there’s already a constraint class with custom message support called TypeResolvableConstraint.
        Valkyrie will then use that message in its validation results.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you provide TypeResolvable support in a property constraint, Valkyrie will add the message to the
        property message (which is also used for the label).
      </para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="validation:hibernate">
    <title>JSR validator integration</title>
    <para>
      JSR303 Bean Validation is a well-known framework for validating JavaBeans, of which Hibernate Validator is the reference
        implementation
    </para>
    <para>
      Simply put, if the object behind a form has JSR303 annotations, by setting the validator to a
      JSR303Validator, it will validate using those annotations. This validator will check all property-based
      validations (no @AssertTrue support at the moment yet). You can even turn off validation for certain properties
      (for example, a code is @NotNull, but in the GUI you’re allowed to leave it empty because you’ll generate one on
      the fly when that’s the case before sending it to the business layer).
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="validation:combining">
    <title>Combining validators</title>
    <para>
      Valkyrie also supports combining different validators. For example, AssertTrue validations are currently
      not checked when using the JSR303 integration. To be able to check those validations, you can
      transform these into rules in the Valkyrie’s rules system. By combining the two, you then have the
      complete validation for your object.
    </para>
    <para>
      Building a composite validator can be done by the following snippet
    </para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[JSR303Validator jsrValidator = ...
RulesValidator rulesValidator = ...
CompositeRichValidator validator = new CompositeRichValidator(new RichValidator[] { jsrValidator, rulesValidator });]]></programlisting>
  </section>
  <section id="validation:own">
    <title>Integrating your own or another third-party validation framework</title>
    <para>
      If you want to integrate your own validation framework, you’ll need to subclass the RichValidator class and wire
      your validator to produce validation results. 
    </para>
