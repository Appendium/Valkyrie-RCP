h1. Valkyrie RCP

h2. What is it ?

A fork of "Valkyrie RCP":http://www.gitorious.org/valkyrie-rcp, which is an evolution of "Spring Rich Client":http://www.springsource.org/spring-rcp


h2. Why ?

Because the original project seems to be dead :(


h2. And so, what's new ?

* Updated dependency to Spring 3.1.1
* Updated dependency to Spring Security 3.1.0
* Fixed broken build for the manual
* Removed "valkyrie-rcp-mydoggy" module because the dependencies were broken.


h2. Greetings

Big thanks to "lievendoclo":https://github.com/lievendoclo for his work on this !
