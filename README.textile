h1. Valkyrie RCP

h2. DISCLAIMER

I'm not the author of this framework, neither related to the author, so please thanks "lievendoclo":http://twitter.com/lievendoclo for his work.

h2. What is it ?

A fork of "Valkyrie RCP":http://www.gitorious.org/valkyrie-rcp, which is itself an evolution of "Spring Rich Client":http://www.springsource.org/spring-rcp.

The Valkyrie documentation is available "here":http://cmadsen.github.com/Valkyrie-RCP/.


h2. Why ?

Because the original project seems to be dead :(


h2. And so, what's new ?

* Updated dependency to Spring 3.2.0
* Updated dependency to Spring Security 3.1.1
* Fixed broken build for the manual
* Removed "valkyrie-rcp-mydoggy" module because the dependencies were broken
* Released a 1.0 version available through a "Maven repository":https://github.com/Ekito/maven-repo
* Publish the "Valkyrie documentation":http://cmadsen.github.com/Valkyrie-RCP/
